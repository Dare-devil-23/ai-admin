# Algebra Fundamentals

## Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols (today written as Latin and Greek letters) represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables.

## Key Concepts

### Variables and Constants

- **Variables**: Symbols that represent unknown values (typically x, y, z)
- **Constants**: Fixed values that don't change (numbers, Ï€, e)

### Expressions and Equations

An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operations:
- $2x + 3y - 5$
- $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$

An equation states that two expressions are equal:
- $x + 5 = 12$
- $2x - 3y = 7$

## Solving Linear Equations

A linear equation has the form $ax + b = 0$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants.

### Steps to solve:
1. Move all terms with the variable to one side
2. Move all constants to the other side
3. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable

**Example:**
Solve $3x - 7 = 11$

$3x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7$  
$3x = 18$  
$x = 6$  

## Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation has the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a \neq 0$.

### Quadratic Formula:
For $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Practice Problems

1. Solve: $5x + 3 = 18$
2. Factor: $x^2 - 9$
3. Solve using the quadratic formula: $2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0$
